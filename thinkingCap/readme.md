For the week 1 thinking cap, I read the article entitled [Rooted in History, Shaping Tomorrow.](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/8426d8bf26e242b6a7ce25c486438477) <br/>


The article highlights the importance of the LA Legacy Business Program and how it supports small business communities. It emphasizes the vital role small businesses play in their local neighborhoods and discusses the various challenges they face, including competition, rising costs, and succession planning. The article also addresses the impact of gentrification on these businesses. Ultimately, the goal is to encourage qualifying small business owners in the City of Los Angeles to apply for recognition as a legacy business.

  I enjoyed reading this article because it shows how business data shapes and impacts the communities where small businesses operate. It highlights how data can tell a deeper story about cultural and economic change. This article also gave me a better idea of the kind of meaningful work I can do with data, using it to support local businesses and influence community-based decisions.

The article has a [dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/ca39c16fffe1411d9cb499376ad81a1d) showing a breakdown of Long-Lasting Small Businesses in the City of Los Angeles. The dashboard looks like it could be built using Microsoft Power BI or tableau. Furthermore, the article has two interactive maps that were created using [ArcGis.](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview) From what I have gathered, ArcGis is similiar to Folium in which it allows a user to generate GIS maps with data they have collected.
