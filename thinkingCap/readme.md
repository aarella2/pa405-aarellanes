For the week 1 thinking cap, I read the article entitled [Rooted in History, Shaping Tomorrow.](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/8426d8bf26e242b6a7ce25c486438477) <br/>


The article highlights the importance of the LA Legacy Business Program and how it supports small business communities. It emphasizes the vital role small businesses play in their local neighborhoods and discusses the various challenges they face, including competition, rising costs, and succession planning. The article also addresses the impact of gentrification on these businesses. Ultimately, the goal is to encourage qualifying small business owners in the City of Los Angeles to apply for recognition as a legacy business.

  I enjoyed reading this article because it shows how business data shapes and impacts the communities where small businesses operate. It highlights how data can tell a deeper story about cultural and economic change. This article also gave me a better idea of the kind of meaningful work I can do with data, using it to support local businesses and influence community-based decisions.

How do you think the graphical outputs (maps/charts) were created for the article? Where did the data come from, and how do you think the outputs were created? Does it work? Why or why not?
