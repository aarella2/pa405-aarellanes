My name is Andres Arellanes. I am from Los Angeles and I like cook. I am interested in GIS and spatial data science because it will allow me to analyze purchasing trends in local small businesses in Los Angeles County.

![This is what I look like](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1e870ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/2160x1441!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2b%2Fea%2Fa2a7685543ac875315994da89200%2F1366152-la-de-los-east-la-classic-football-game-roosevelt-garfield11.JPG)<br />

I will be analyzing local small business enterprise (LSBE) spending in relation to their district locations within the county. I look forward to mapping each LSBE to determine whether certain Board of Supervisors districts attract more small businesses and if so, exploring the factors that contribute to this trend.
