# Assignment 2: Submitting data sources
## Local Small Businesses registered with Los Angeles County
I am utilizing Local Small Business registration data from the [ISD Preference Program Entities](https://camisvr.co.la.ca.us/LACoBids/CertList/VendorCert) and [recently awarded ISD bids](https://camisvr.co.la.ca.us/LACoBids/BidLookUp/GenBidList) to idetify which vendors are registered as LSBEs and to determine who has been awarded Purchase orders. <br/>


By using this data, I will be able to determine which LSBE vendors are active. It is entirely possible that some vendors register but do not participate in county solicitations.
